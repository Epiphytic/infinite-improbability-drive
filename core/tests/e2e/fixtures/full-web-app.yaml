  Requirements:
  - Use Rust with Axum for the web framework
  - SQLite database for storage
  - JWT authentication using a locally generated private key
  - REST API for CRUD operations on a "notes" table (id, title, content, created_at)
  - Simple HTML UI for login and viewing/creating notes
  - Unit tests for the authentication logic
  - Integration tests that show the ability to add and delete notes through the API
  - E2E test of login flow using the test client

  The application should:
  1. Compile with `cargo build`
  2. Pass unit tests with `cargo test --lib`
  3. Pass integration tests with `cargo test --test integration`
