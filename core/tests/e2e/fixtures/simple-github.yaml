# Planning prompt - generates a plan document
planning_prompt: |
  Create an implementation plan for building a simple greeting library in Rust.

  IMPORTANT: Create a file called PLAN.md in the ROOT of the repository (not in a subdirectory).

  The PLAN.md file should contain:
  1. Overview section describing what we're building
  2. Tasks section with numbered tasks
  3. Each task should have a description

  Keep it simple - just 2-3 tasks for:
  - Setting up Cargo.toml
  - Creating the lib.rs with a greet function
  - Adding a simple test

  Create the PLAN.md file at the repository root.

# Execution prompt - implements the plan
prompt: |
  You have a PLAN.md file in this repository. Read it and implement the plan.

  Create a simple Rust project with:
  1. Cargo.toml - name "greetlib", edition 2021
  2. src/lib.rs - a public function `greet(name: &str) -> String` that returns "Hello, {name}!"
  3. A test in the same file that verifies greet("World") returns "Hello, World!"

  Make sure the code compiles and tests pass.
